What is your something cool?
-------
As per the handout, using an array to store the hex values that define each step and implementing properly is considered 
something cool. 

Post-lab Questions
-------
1) The ABI assumes a standard for all argument passing across Assembly and C programming. Thus, all subroutines must follow the
ARM EABI protocol in passing an argument and in returning a result to avoid confusion and reinventing the wheel 
every time someone has to use a function created by someone else. 

2) C stores local variables on the stack to allow for easy reuse of variable names and 
instructions across multiple functions in the same file. ie. passing the same variable uint_t size to multiple
different functions in the program. Also it allows for more than 4 base registers to be used when passing arguments 
to a function. The compiler takes care of the stack management for you.
