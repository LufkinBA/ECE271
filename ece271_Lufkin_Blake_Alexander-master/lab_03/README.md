What is your something cool?
-------
# is a backspace
* clears all current numbers on screen

Post-lab Questions
-------
generally it cannot unless you add some sort of special algorithm or if the
hardware is set up as open drain instead of push pull. 
One potential solution would be to, once you get the column pressed you switch the columns to output
then the rows to input when the rows are scanned. Then you could pick up on the high signal on both buttons without 
a short circuit
