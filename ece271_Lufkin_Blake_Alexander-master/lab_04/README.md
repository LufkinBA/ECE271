What is your something cool?
-------
Joystick center for fullstepping 
Joystick left for halfstepping 
LCD displays current angle of the stepper motor

Post-lab Questions
-------
1)Theoretically you could use an external power source connected by resistors to give you the current you needed. 
However that could cause feedback into the GPIO pins and fry the board. You could also use a bigger transistor than the
Darlington array to achieve a higher current.

2)Yes, with microstepping you can get 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, or even 1/32 of a full step.
