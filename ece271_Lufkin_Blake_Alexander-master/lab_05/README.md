Post-lab Questions
-------
1) For readability, its much easer to define a name for a specific register than to use a hex value that could easily 
be mis-typed or mis-calculated. 

2) The compliler might use PC relative addressing to attempt to store the entire constant then it would only OR one register
to andother (Least Significant Bits) ignoring the most significant bits stored in another register.
