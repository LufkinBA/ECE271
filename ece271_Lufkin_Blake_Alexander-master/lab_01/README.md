Post-lab Questions
-------
1. When the switch is open the capacitor is fully charged; when the button is pressed the capacitor discharges.
If the button rebounds and the switch is open briefly, the capacitor cannot be recharged quick enough to pull the 
processor pin low.
2. By using a simple wait-and-see method. When the button is pressed, it reexamines the the imput signal after a 
short delay, usually 20-50ms. 
3. A large slew rate often causes high electromagnetic interference to nearby circuits. So, through radiation, 
conduction, or induction the signal may cause malfunctions in other parts of the circuit. A lower
slew rate is suggested for controling the LED function.
